    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>We observed that Gaza is going through one of the toughest humanitarian crises in modern times, and this deeply touched our hearts. Every day, we saw stories of families struggling for survival, children losing access to education, and communities living in fear and uncertainty. We wanted to help — not just through words, but through real action that could make even a small difference.</p>

    <p>After spending several days brainstorming ideas, we came up with a vision — Gazim. The goal of Gazim is simple yet powerful: to create a platform that allows everyone, regardless of financial background, to contribute to humanitarian relief efforts for Gaza.</p>

    <p>However, we quickly realized that not everyone can donate money, especially students, young people, and those facing financial limitations. This insight pushed us to think differently. After a few more days of research, we discovered Google AdMob, a platform that enables revenue generation through ad views. That’s when the idea became clearer — people can support Gaza simply by using our app and watching ads, turning their time and attention into meaningful financial support.</p>

    <p>Now, our team is fully committed to developing Gazim, refining its structure, and making it as impactful as possible. We are determined to use technology as a bridge between compassion and action — where even a single view, click, or share can help bring relief to those in need.</p>

    <p>Our mission is not just to raise funds, but to build awareness, unity, and hope. We believe that when people come together with empathy and purpose, even small actions can create massive change.</p>

    <p>Join us on this journey. Together, we can turn time into hope, and hope into a brighter future for Gaza.</p>
