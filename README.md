# Gazim-v2

# To enable people worldwide to support humanitarian causes (with primary focus on Gaza, Palestine, Sudan, and other crisis-affected regions) through ethical digital engagement such as games, books, movies, and direct donations. Gazim is designed for people who want to help but cannot always donate directly. Instead of forcing money-only donations, Gazim converts attention, time, and engagement into real-world aid. Gazim operates on a charity-first equity and governance model, ensuring transparency, trust, and long-term impact.
